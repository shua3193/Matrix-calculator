# Matrix-calculator

In these files is a matrix calculator coded in python.
MatrixFuncs.py is a file containing all the functions called upon by Matrix Calculator.py
They must be in the same file stored to work.
Alternatively, if MatrixFuncs.py is copy/pasted into Matrix Calculator.py before the code then funcions will work.
If this is done the "from MatrixFuncs import * " on line 5 must be removed.
